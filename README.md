# Weather-Dashboard
A powerful responsive weather dashboard is being designed and developed using Angular JAVA, HTML, CSS , bootstrap and WeatherAPIs to call the weather calls in the UI

The dashboard enables the user to locate any location's weather in the search placeholder.
The dashboard shows the current weather for the searched location, including current temperature, hourly temperature for the current day and also weekly forecast for upcoming days' weather.
It gives a detailed information on UV index, Wind Status, Sunrise, Sunset, Humidity, Visibility and Air Quality.
The dashboard has a special functionality of seeing the weather temperature in both Celsius and Fahrenheit.
The dashboard has used WeatherAPIs (https://www.weatherapi.com/) to call the weather calls to the UI.
The dashboard is completely owned by me.
